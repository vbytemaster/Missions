		<NonLocaleText>This map can be played by 2 to 4 people.

To win, you have to hold the enemy base without losing your home base (there are bases, the East Flag &amp; the West Flag).

The reinforcements are sent in accordance with the names of flags.

Having combinations of flags gives a team an opportunity to get mixed reinforcements.

To hold a flag you should leave some troops near it.</NonLocaleText>
